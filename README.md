Grid trading, on the other hand, is a method where a trader sets up a network of buy and sell orders at predetermined price intervals around a set price level. This strategy capitalizes on the natural market volatility by executing trades when the price hits these predefined levels. The primary aim is to profit from small fluctuations in price, regardless of the market's overall direction.

Improvement Ideas
- Use Hidden Markov Model to determine suitable market regime to execute the trading strategy
- Rewrite the code with websocket and asynchronous strcuture(The original code use http request to get market data, account information)
- Backtest to optimize the parameters
- Find an alternative for pandas to read the request response(e.g. open orders)
